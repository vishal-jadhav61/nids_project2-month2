# nids_project2-month2
This project focused on implementing a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort, one of the most widely-used open-source NIDS tools. The goal was to set up Snort in IDS mode, create and test custom rules, monitor live network traffic, and analyze alerts generated by malicious or suspicious activities.

**Month 2: Intermediate Tasks for Continuing Students**

**Week Tasks**

**Week 1**


• In-depth Snort rule syntax

• Write at least 2 custom detection rules

• Integrate custom rules into configuration


**Week 2**

• Simulate attacks: TCP port scan, SSH brute force

• Verify alerts for custom rules

• Analyze detection quality


**Week 3**

• Identify false positives in logs

• Suppress noisy rules, fine-tune alerts

• Adjust rules for better precision


**Week 4**

• Compile report with custom rules, attack simulations, alert
analysis


**Deliverables – Month 2**

• Detailed report containing:

o Custom Snort rules

o Description of simulated attacks and results

o False positive analysis and optimizations
