# nids_project2-month2
This project focused on implementing a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort, one of the most widely-used open-source NIDS tools. The goal was to set up Snort in IDS mode, create and test custom rules, monitor live network traffic, and analyze alerts generated by malicious or suspicious activities.
